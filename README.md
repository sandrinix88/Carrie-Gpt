Carrie GPT â€“ A Persona-Based Conversational Agent

Inspired by Sex and the City, this project generates responses in the voice of Carrie Bradshaw using GPT-2 Medium fine-tuned with LoRA and integrated with RAG.

Project Overview

Carrie GPT is a persona-based chatbot designed to respond like Carrie Bradshaw. The system combines:

GPT-2 Medium: Base language model.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Efficient fine-tuning for personality-specific responses.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Adds context from a curated script dataset for coherent, context-aware replies.

The goal is to explore NLP techniques in persona-based conversational AI while demonstrating practical fine-tuning and retrieval strategies.
